Principles of Programming

Welcome to my repository for my Intro to Java - Principles of Programming Code. 

To view the different codes for each chapter, view the different branches. 

Principles of Programming introduces the student to object-oriented programming. Students will learn how to write code and develop strategies to solve problems. Topics covered include: creating classes, decision structures, loops, file I/O, arrays, text processing and wrapper classes.

Course Objectives  
1. Write code that uses variables, decision statements, arrays, conditional and loop constructs. (PG5) 
2. Manipulate primitive numeric data and string data. (PG5) 
3. Create Java classes and use object references. (PG2) 
4. Access the fields and methods of an object. (PG2) 
5. Access and create static fields and methods. (PG2) 
6. Create arrays and array lists (PG4) 
7. Debug programs by fixing syntax and logical errors. (PG2) 
8. Explain how a program works by going through the code line by line. (PG1,PG4,PG5,GE1,PG1,PG2,PG4,PG5)
